Time series shiny app

This repository contains a Shiny app that allows users to visualize time series data using five different plot types: Time Series Plot, Scatter Plot, Box Plot, Density Plot, and Seasonal Plot. Users can interactively select a plot type using buttons in the app's sidebar, and the selected plot is rendered in the main panel. The app also provides brief explanations for each plot type to help users understand the visualizations better.
